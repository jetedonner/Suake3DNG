# Suake3DNG
This project is a clone of the 2D mobile phone (Nokia) game Snake versus the 3D ego shooter Quake. It all started as a test project for applying the
knowledge of my studies in the field of 3D modelling, animation and programming. At the moment this game is only available for macOS and was developed with
SceneKit, GameKit, Swift and of course XCode. For 3D modelling and animation I used Autodesk Maya and Blender a free 3D modelling suite. The project uses several original as well as amended 3D models which I downloaded from the net. Please see the Credits section for indication of sources and and references.
