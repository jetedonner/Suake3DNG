# Suake3DNG
This project is a clone of the 2D mobile phone (Nokia) game Snake versus the 3D ego shooter Quake. It all started as a test project for applying the
knowledge of my studies in the field of 3D modelling, animation and programming. At the moment this game is only available for macOS and was developed with
SceneKit, GameKit, Swift and of course XCode.

Thank you for your interest in this project.
